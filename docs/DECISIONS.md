# Architecture Decision Records

Short ADRs. Format: context → decision → consequences. Status: Accepted / Superseded.

## ADR-001: Cloud storage and hosting — Accepted (2026-10-27)
**Context:** The brainstorming doc left storage open (cloud vs on-prem vs hybrid).
**Decision:** Cloud. Managed PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS with daily backups and point-in-time recovery; S3-compatible object storage for CAD files, tiles and photos (MinIO locally); services run as Docker containers.
**Consequences:** No on-prem servers to maintain. Original CAD files are kept read-only in object storage; As-Built versions are separate objects. Internet is needed for the web app; the mobile app works offline and syncs.

## ADR-002: AutoCAD processing on the server only — Accepted (2026-10-27)
**Context:** Open question whether AutoCAD is needed on user machines.
**Decision:** v1 is web + mobile only. DWG/DXF is read and written by the Python worker (ODA File Converter / LibreDWG for DWG→DXF, ezdxf for parsing and As-Built DXF export). No local AutoCAD plugin.
**Consequences:** Users do not need AutoCAD licences to use the platform. Exported As-Built DXF must be verified in AutoCAD/BricsCAD as part of acceptance. A local plugin can be added later behind the same API.

## ADR-003: Technology stack — Accepted (2026-10-27)
**Decision:** As defined in the build plan: pnpm + Turborepo monorepo; NestJS API; Next.js web; Expo React Native mobile with MapLibre + Skia + WatermelonDB; Python 3.12 CAD worker; PostgreSQL/PostGIS; Redis/BullMQ; Martin/PMTiles; GitHub Actions.
**Consequences:** Shared TypeScript contracts across web, mobile and API; Python is limited to the CAD worker.

## ADR-004: Clean architecture + modular monolith — Accepted (2026-10-27)
**Decision:** One NestJS module per bounded context with domain / application / infrastructure / interface layers (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Contract-first schemas in `packages/shared`.
**Consequences:** Modules can be developed in parallel by separate agents against fixed contracts, and can be split into services later if needed.

## ADR-005: Agent and model routing — Accepted (2026-10-27)
**Decision:** Hard reasoning (architecture, finance, geometry, sync, security) → Opus; feature implementation and tests → Sonnet; mechanical work (scaffolding, i18n, lint, docs, search) → Haiku. Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/`. Contracts are fixed first so implementation agents can run in parallel worktrees.
**Consequences:** Most tokens are spent on Sonnet/Haiku; Opus is used where a mistake is expensive.
